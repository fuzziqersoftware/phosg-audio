phosg-audio is a basic C++ wrapper library around OpenAL.

Building & installing on macOS or Linux:
0. Make sure you have Make, g++ and OpenAL installed.
1. `make`
2. `sudo make install`

Building on Windows is not straightforward. Install MinGW-w64, then read the
comments in the makefile.

Should work on macOS, Ubuntu (and probably other Linuxes), and Windows.
